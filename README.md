# 🌿 Echo Saver Shrine

Created by **Kesio Mtewa**, a shrine-keeper from **Neno, Malawi**, this CS50x final project is a Flask-powered web shrine for music distribution and emotional testimony. It was built to promote talented but under-recognized artists in rural Malawi — especially those whose voices deserve to be heard beyond the village.

Every scroll is a ritual. Every verse is a blessing.

## 🌍 Purpose

This shrine was built to promote talented but under-recognized artists in rural Malawi. Many musicians in Neno, Blantyre, and surrounding areas create powerful songs but lack platforms for distribution. Echo Saver Shrine offers a digital altar — a place to submit, store, and share praise songs and testimonies with the world.

It is a communal offering, a bridge between local sound and global reach.

> “We built this shrine so the unheard could be honored.  
> Every verse is a seed. Every playback is a blessing.”
